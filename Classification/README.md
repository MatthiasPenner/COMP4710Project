# Classification and Feature Selection Algorithms

To run all the combinations of feature selection algorithms, run the command `python full.py`. Warning, this will take 3-5 hours to run and produce a lot of output. Please see fullResults.txt to see sample output.

To run the 5 highest performing algorithms, get more detailed results, and an ROC curve, run `python detailedResults.py`. This will take around a minute to run.
